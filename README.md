# Console Social Media
A simple and effective command line social media built in JAVA. This prototype is a result of my exploration of concepts in JAVA. I have used a custom file system for storing the user records and the relevent records for the application. This file system acts as a simple database solution for the application.

The application contains a built-in authentication system and a user record management system to provide overall better security and exprience to user accounts and the users respectively.

The console social media has the primary social media features.

### The features include :
- User accounts
  - Profile page
  - Follow/unfollow user
  - Search for users

- Posts
  - Public post
  - Comments
  - Like/unlike post
  - Feeds

 The feeds is tailored to provide the latest posts from the users followed by a user. The further development of this prototype would be to build an API model to convert this application to a client-server architecture.
